# Simulating quantum physics using quantum computers
People have done some impressive work on simulating classical systems. But 'dammit', according to R. Feynman in 1981, that's not good enough as mother nature is in essence quantum mechanical. We want to know her better, thus quantum computation.

### Notes on some useful quantum-information-related topics
I'm a physics Ph.D. student doing research in this field. Here I'll post some of my notes on stuff I deem useful for people, but mostly me, to understand this topic. Since the majority of the audience is me, I'm assuming him to have a decent understanding of undergrad level linear algebra and quantum mechanics.
